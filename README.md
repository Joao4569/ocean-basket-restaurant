## Conception

My thinking was that given the requirements of the project, it would be very beneficial to formulate some kind of plan which would lay out the basic scope, logic and design of my project in order to have some kind of structure with which to work with in order to avoid missing any crucial steps during construction and make the whole construction process as efficient as possible.

I made use of the following resources in order to plan and visualise my project after reading the project requirements:
 - I made use of [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/) in order to visualise the scope and logic of my ideas and thought processes, as well to manage my project using Agile methodology and common practices, that were appropriate for this project and taught to me by Code Institute.
 - I made use of [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) in order to create a basic wireframe design for Luigi's webpages.


### Project Scope

After reading the requirements for the project and the User's goal for the idea that I chose, I started working on a flowchart in order to visualise my idea and the thought processes behind it. I came up with four main categories of requirements for the project, functionality required from the application, data needed for the required functionality, data tables which will store the data required and technologies that I would like to make use of for the project.

I did this in order to have some basic structure and goals laid out which I could use as a guideline for the construction of the project and as a form of checklist which I could use to keep track of my progression as I proceed with the constsruction of the application.

***Scope flowchart placeholder***

 - Functionality was divided into two categories. The first was for functionality that was needed in order to meet the clients requirements as per the User's goal, labeled as "Must have's" in red, and the second was for functionality that I thought may be useful for the business and also logical next steps after meeting the basic requirements of the project, labelled as "Could have's" in green.

***Functionality flowchart placeholder***

 - I divided Data into three categories which made up different entities that needed data attributed to them in order for the business logic behind the project to make sense to a client and owner, in a real world situation, given the requirements of the project and it's goal.

***Data flowchart placeholder***

 - My next logical step was to come up with some basic idea of how to organise and store important data in relational databases designed for different user's needs, namely clients and employees in a way that was logical as well as neccessary for the required functionality of the project. I decided two basic tables were needed, one for storing booking data and another for using some of that data in a usefull manner for various employee's needs.

  - And next I had to decide on which technologies to use for the project in order to best suite it's requirements and application, I would have to use multiple languages and a MVC Framework. The languages would be HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python, and I chose Django as the Fullstack MVC framework and possibly also make use of Bootstrap for some UX and design features at a later stage.

### Project Logic

Once I had a basic idea of what I wanted to create, I then proceeded to draw up a flowchart in order to visualise the logic behind the functionality required for the project. This I believe will be extremely helpfull throughout production of the applicaton bby giving myself a specific plan to follow and avoid any unnecessary detours during construction.

### Basic Wireframe Design

Once I had the basic scope and logic in place, I then proceeded to design a visual representation of what is needed for the basic functionality of the project from a user's point of view and how I would represent that.

## Testing

- Found bug 
  - **Resolved** 
- Sourced most common media breakpoint widths on [www.freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-media-queries-breakpoints-media-types-standard-resolutions-and-more/.) and made the site responsive down to minimum width of 320 pixels.
  - Mobile devices: 320px — 480px
  - iPads, Tablets: 481px — 768px
  - Small screens, laptops: 769px — 1024px
  - Desktops, large screens: 1025px — 1200px
  - Extra large screens, TV: 1201px and more
- Made use of Chrome developer tools for previewing and testing new designs for media queries as well as UX aspects.
- I have tested all buttons and links, they are all acting as intended.
